# Patient Tracker Application

Welcome to the Patient Tracker application! This is an ongoing project aimed at creating a patient management system using Python, HTML, and connecting to an SQL database.

## Project Overview

The Patient Tracker application is designed to track patient information in a secure and intuitive manner. The current features include patient registration and a simple API for storing patient records. The application is actively being developed, and future enhancements will include:

- **Secure Registration:** Implement secure user registration with authentication mechanisms.
- **Patient and Admin Portals:** Create dedicated portals for patients and administrators to manage their respective information.
- **Search and Edit Functions:** Implement search and edit functions for efficient management of patient information.
- **Intuitive Design:** Strive for an intuitive and user-friendly interface for a seamless user experience.
- **Customization:** Add customization options to tailor the application to specific user needs.
